Hello, I just wanted to start off by saying how much I love the LCDuino relay volume controller, it has been working great in my system for about 4 years now. I have even built a couple of them for my friends and they really enjoy them and the simplicity of the menu setup. I have been having a problem with mine lately, it seems that from what I have been reading that the Atmel 328 chip used in the LCDuino has a limited number of EEPROM write cycles about 100,000. I have looked through the source code and it seems that the LCDuino rely's heavily on the internal EEPROM to store states and settings. After using it for a number of years the LCDuino won't startup anymore because of EEPROM damage, I just get blocks through the LCD. If I reflash a new chip with your source code it comes back to life and works fine again. My friends would not know how to do this, so I was wondering if you could change the code to write to a external FRAM chip like this one https://www.adafruit.com/product/1895 It is a I2C FRAM chip which I think could be attached to the already in-use I2C bus. I'm not very good at programming and I cannot get the source code to compile once I make the changes to include that chip. Your help would be greatly appreciated as including such a chip would make your product last for many many more years. Thank You.

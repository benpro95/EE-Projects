Volu-Master(tm) firmware for LCDuino-1
Change Log
---------------------------------------

v1.02:	- The MinVol/MaxVol menu now allows the minimum and
	  maximum settings to be the same, which locks the
	  volume to the chosen setting.
	- When pressing the front pushbutton to turn off the power,
	  the amount of time required to hold the pushbutton down
	  has been reduced slightly.
	- Some Arduino 1.6.x libraries and headers have changed
	  locations, so Makefile-1.6 now auto-detects them
	  and set the paths appropriately.  This has been tested up
	  to Arduino 1.6.13.
	- Change Makefile-1.0 to make it auto-detect the location
	  of the avrdude program.

v1.01:
	- Changes to make the code compatible with Arduino 1.0.x,
	  1.5.x and 1.6.x.
	- Separate Makefiles are supplied for each of these Arduino
	  environments.
	- Arduino prior to 1.0 are no longer supported.
	- Fixes to feature selection in config.h to avoid compile
	  errors when certain combinations are specified.
	- The unsupported USE_PGA_I2C and USE_SPDIF code are now
	  disabled by default to reduce memory usage.
	- When selecting input or output ports, the "pop-up"
	  notification screen that shows the old and new ports
	  now only appears when in "big font" display mode.
	  In other display modes, the changes are shown directly
	  in the corresponding fields on the screen.
	- Several other minor user interface enhancements.
	- Code formatting clean-up to make it more readable.

v1.00:
	- Initial release
	- Must use Arduino 0022 or 0023
	- Must compile with avr-gcc/avr-g++ 4.3.x.
